    <h5>简介</h5>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
The idea behind testing is not new. You can’t sleep well if you are not confident that your last commit didn’t take down the whole application. Having your application covered with tests gives you more trust in the stability of your application. That’s all.

In most cases tests don’t guarantee that the application works 100% as it is supposed to. You can’t predict all possible scenarios and exceptional situations for complex apps, but with tests you can cover the most important parts of your app and at least be sure they work as predicted.

There are plenty of ways to test your application. The most popular paradigm is Unit Testing. As for web applications, testing the controller, or model in isolation doesn’t prove your application is working. To test the behavior of your application as a whole, you should write functional or acceptance tests.

The Codeception testing framework distinguishes these levels of testing. Out of the box you have tools for writing unit, functional, and acceptance tests in a single manner.

Let’s review the listed testing paradigms in reverse order.
    </pre>

    <h5>Acceptance Tests</h5>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
How does your client, manager, or tester, or any other non-technical person, know your website is working? By opening the browser, accessing a site, clicking on links, filling in the forms, and actually seeing the content on a web page. That person has no idea of the framework, database, web-server, or programming language you use or why the application did not behave as expected.

Acceptance tests can cover standard but complex scenarios from a user’s perspective. With acceptance tests you can be confident that users, following all defined scenarios, won’t get errors.

Please, note that any website can be covered with acceptance tests. Even if you use a very custom CMS or framework.
    </pre>

    <h6>Sample acceptance test</h6>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
&lt;?php
$I = new AcceptanceTester($scenario);
$I->amOnPage('/');
$I->click('Sign Up');
$I->submitForm('#signup', ['username' => 'MilesDavis', 'email' => 'miles@davis.com']);
$I->see('Thank you for Signing Up!');
    </pre>
    <h6>Pros</h6>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
can be run on any website
can test javascript and ajax requests
can be shown to your clients and managers
most stable in support: less affected by changes in source code or technologies
    </pre>
    <h6>Cons</h6>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
the slowest: requires running browser and database repopulation
fewer checks can lead to false-positive results
yep, they are really slow
not stable in execution: rendering and javascript issues can lead to unpredictable results
    </pre>            
    <h5>Functional Tests</h5>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
What if we could check our application without running it on a server? This way we could see detailed exceptions on errors, have tests running faster, and check the database for values we expect. That’s what functional tests are for.

For functional tests you emulate a web request ($_GET and $_POST variables) and send it into your application which returns HTML response. Inside a test you can make assertions about the response, and you can check if the data was successfully stored into the database.

For functional tests your application should be prepared to be run in a test environment. Codeception provides connectors to several popular PHP frameworks, or you could write your own.
    </pre>
    <h6>Sample functional test</h6>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
&lt;?php
$I = new FunctionalTester($scenario);
$I->amOnPage('/');
$I->click('Sign Up');
$I->submitForm('#signup', ['username' => 'MilesDavis', 'email' => 'miles@davis.com']);
$I->see('Thank you for Signing Up!');
$I->seeEmailSent('miles@davis.com', 'Thank you for registration');
$I->seeInDatabase('users', ['email' => 'miles@davis.com']);              
    </pre>
    <h6>Pros</h6>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
like acceptance tests, but much faster
can provide more detailed reports
you can still show this code to managers and clients
stable enough: only major code changes, or moving to other framework, can break them            
    </pre>
    <h6>Cons</h6>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
javascript and ajax can’t be tested
by emulating the browser you might get more false-positive results
requires a framework
    </pre>
